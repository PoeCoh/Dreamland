# User Database
I've thought about going two different directions with this and I'm open to either. The first is as mentioned in the main document, the second would be to store user skills instead, and assign jobs skill requirements per process. Most likely in a json file in each process folder, ex:
```json
{
    "Solder":"2",
    "Test":"3"
}
```
For the uninitiated jsons are just extremely easy to use with almost every language, and are simple enough that those who don't know computer languages can understand.
