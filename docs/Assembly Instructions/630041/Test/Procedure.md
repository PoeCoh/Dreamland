Inova | Slimline | 630041

## PURPOSE AND SCOPE
   The purpose of this document is to specify the setup and procedures required to perform a production verification test of the 630041 and 630043 board assemblies.
   
## REQUIRED MATERIALS
   - Test Fixture w/ wall wart power suppply
   - RS232 Serial Cable
   - Schematic

## TEST SETUP
   By virtue of the design of the test set, EDM Engineering has determined that this test set does not require periodic calibration. Before each use, verify the test set function by blocking a few of the photo inputs with a small post-it note or other piece of paper. The DUT should fail with the inputs blocked. This test should be sufficient to verify proper operation of the test set.
   1. Plug in wall wart into the AC outlet, this will power up the test fixture
   2. Make sure the photo-detector area on the test set is clean and free of debris
   3. If desired, connect the serial port on the test set to a PC running serial terminal software to provide additional debugging information
